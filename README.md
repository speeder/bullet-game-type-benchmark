# Shooting Game C99 Type Benchmark #

This is a benchmark of performance in both memory use and CPU use of several C99 types when creating an array of structures to save the fired bullets of a shooter game.

This was created for a article written on my personal site.  [http://coderofworlds.com/testing-performance-of-c99-types-within-a-game-data-structure/]
